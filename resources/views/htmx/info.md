### Overview

This document briefly explains three key components (`chat`, `messages-list`, and `thread-list`) of a chat application and how they leverage HTMX for dynamic functionality.

### Components

#### 1. Chat Component (`chat.blade.php`)

- **Description:** Serves as the main layout, integrating `messages-list` for displaying messages and `thread-list` for listing chat threads.
- **HTMX Usage:**
    - Initiates an HTMX request to load threads on load.
    - Defines `main-chat` as the update target for dynamic content.

#### 2. Messages List Component (`messages-list.blade.php`)

- **Description:** Displays messages for the selected thread, including thread title and individual messages.

- **HTMX Usage:**
    - Acts as a target for HTMX updates but does not directly use HTMX.

#### 3. Thread List Component (`thread-list.blade.php`)

- **Description:** Lists all available threads, allowing users to click and load the corresponding messages in the main chat area.

- **HTMX Usage:**

    - Makes HTMX requests to fetch and display thread messages dynamically.
    - Attributes like `hx-target` and `hx-swap` determine where and how the fetched content is injected.
    - Updates browser history with `hx-push-url`.

### Summary

These components collaboratively create an interactive chat interface. HTMX facilitates dynamic content loading and interaction, reducing the need for extensive JavaScript and enhancing maintainability.
